        Canvas
      </h4>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>What is the business model canvas?</strong> The business model canvas is a simple, yet powerful 9-box diagram that captures all aspects of your business model. The canvas is widely becoming a standard amongst enterprises and startups alike in business model innovation. It was created by the folks at <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com">Business Model Generation</a>, Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>Can I change the box headers within the canvas?</strong> The default headers use the original names as defined by the Business Model Generation folks. Many people have asked for the ability to change the names of the boxes to the ones used by Ash Maurya’s leancanvas.com. To change the headers, click on the Settings icon from the Canvas tab and select the ‘Startup’ radio button under Canvas Version.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>When should I use different color post-it notes on the canvas?</strong> You should use different color post-it notes to capture <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sided_market">multi-sided markets</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>How do I link items on my canvas to items in the Plan?</strong> When you create a new canvas item, you will see a checkbox at the bottom of the form called ‘Include in Plan’. Checking that box will create a hypothesis in the Plan. You can also modify the canvas settings to always include canvas items in the Plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>Why do some of my canvas items have red text?</strong> Items appear with red text if they were created this week. This is useful to see what changes occurred since the previous week. To disable the red text, click on the settings icon from the Canvas tab and uncheck the box labeled ‘Highlight new canvas items with red text’.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>How do I change the color of an existing post-it note on my canvas?</strong> To change the color of a post-it note, click on the post-it note to edit it. Then click on one of the small post-it icons under the ‘Color’ section.

      <h4>
        The Plan
      </h4>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>What is the Plan?</strong> One of the most important activities for early stage teams building new products is to find product-market fit. The Plan is where you can map out and define hypotheses, experiments, and tasks and track your progress towards achieving product-market fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>What are hypotheses, experiments, and tasks?</strong> The Plan supports three types of items: hypotheses, experiments, and tasks. Hypotheses are essentially guesses or assumptions about your business model that you want to test. Experiments are controlled and measured tests between your users and your application. Experiments should be performed to validate or invalidate a hypothesis in your Plan. Tasks are small units of work that you need to accomplish to support an experiment or hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>How much detail should I capture in each hypothesis, experiment, and task?</strong> Generally speaking, the more detail you capture, the better. This is especially important for Experiments since there is typically setup required and clear definition of what you are measuring to determine success or failure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>Are email notifications sent to members of a project whenever a new hypothesis, experiment, or task is created?</strong> Yes, email notifications are sent whenever you create a new hypothesis, experiment, or task within the Plan. Emails are also sent when a comment is posted and when a hypothesis, experiment, or task is completed or validated/invalidated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>How do I write a good hypothesis?</strong> A good hypothesis should be defined in a way that it is testable and can be proven or dis-proven. Avoid “leap-of-faith” hypotheses like <i>“Startups need a tool to manage lean startup activities”</i>. A better hypothesis is <i>“I believe startups using StartupManager will come back at least once per week because our tools make it easier to define and test business model hypotheses.”</i> Here’s a great blog post by Ben Yoskovitz on how to write a good hypothesis: <a href="http://www.instigatorblog.com/good-hypotheses/2011/05/05/">http://www.instigatorblog.com/good-hypotheses/2011/05/05/</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>How do I test a hypothesis?</strong> Once you’ve structured your hypothesis in a way that is clear and testable, it’s time to define an experiment that can either validate or invalidate your hypothesis statement. Click on the ‘New Experiment’ button to create a new experiment. Give it a title and describe your experiment in the description field. We recommend that you capture as much detail as necessary to explain what you are testing, how, and what metrics you are measuring.

        The Journal
      </h4>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>What is the Journal?</strong> The Journal is where you compose team updates and store customer interviews. We recommend composing at least one update per week to keep everyone in the loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>What’s the difference between an interview and an update?</strong> Use Interviews to store feedback from specific customers. Use Updates to update your team on what you have done, what you learned, and what the plan is moving forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>How often should I create updates?</strong> We recommend creating updates at least once per week.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>What questions should I ask during a customer interview?</strong> During customer interviews you should be asking them the following questions:<br>
        - How are they currently addressing this problem?<br>
        - What do they like about the current solution? What don’t they like?<br>
        - What do they wish they could do that isn’t possible today? How would that make their lives easier?<br>
        - Who is involved in the current solution or process? How long does it take?<br>
        - How much money are they willing to invest in a solution to this problem?<br>
        For more on customer interviews, read Chapter 3 (Customer Discovery) of “The Four Steps to the Epiphany” by Steve Blank.

        Email Notifications
      </h4>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>Who gets an email when I create a new item in the Plan or Journal?</strong> All members of your project are eligible to receive an email notification whenever a new item is created in the Plan or Journal. Emails are also sent when a comment is left or when a hypothesis or experiment is validated/invalidated or completed. However, all members have the ability to control which types of emails they receive so they may not receive notifications for all events.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><a name="#"/>Are email notifications sent when a comment is left?</strong> Yes, email notifications are sent when a comment is posted. However, if a member of your project turned off emails for hypotheses, they will not receive new comment email notifications for hypotheses.
